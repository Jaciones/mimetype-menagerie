======================
The Mimetype Menagerie
======================

-----
Goals
-----

At least one valid, representative file for every mimetype.

--------
Criteria
--------

In order of priority:

#. Public domain or Creative Commons licensing.
#. Correctly represents the mimetype.
#. Relatively small file size (to save disk space and bandwidth).
#. Stable URI (permalinks are best).

-----------------
Is that possible?
-----------------

The IANA lists `about 1500 registered mimetypes`_,
some of which are deprecated.
There are many more which are unofficial.

It's a big job, but not impossible.

.. about 1500 registered mimetypes: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml

----
Why?
----

A reference library of examples of filetypes is useful,
and the amount of required disk space
is quite reasonable on modern hard drives.

-----
Notes
-----

Some mimetypes may not have any public domain examples,
or may be patent-encumbered.
These can be linked to,
but will have to be omitted from the actual git repository.
